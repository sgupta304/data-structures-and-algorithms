# Challenges
## Reverse an Array
Write a function called `reverseArray` which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

#### Example
|  Input | Output  | 
|---|---|
| ```[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]```  |  ```[6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]``` | 
| ```[89, 2354, 3546, 23, 10, -923, 823, -12]```  |  ```[-12, 823, -923, 10, 23, 3546, 2354, 89]``` | 
| ```[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199]```  |  ```[199, 197, 193, 191, 181, 179, 173, 167, 163, 157, 151, 149, 139, 137, 131, 127, 113, 109, 107, 103, 101, 97, 89, 83, 79, 73, 71, 67, 61, 59, 53, 47, 43, 41, 37, 31, 29, 23, 19, 17, 13, 11, 7, 5, 3, 2]``` | 
	
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

__Note__: There is no test requirement for Class01. Going forward you will be required to test any code you produce unless otherwise directed by your instructional team.

#### Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

#### Solution
- [ ] Take a photo of your completed whiteboard, matching the example whiteboard layout.
    - [ ] Copy your photo into an /assets directory in your repo
    - [ ] Give the image file the same name as the branch you are working on
    - [ ] Embed the image in your README.md documentation
- [x] Create a pull request from your branch to your master branch
- [x] In your open pull request, leave as a comment a checklist of the specifications and tasks above, with the actual steps that you completed checked off
- [ ] Submitting your completed work to Canvas:
    - [ ] Copy the link to your open pull request and paste it into the corresponding Canvas assignment
    - [ ] Leave a description of how long this assignment took you in the comments box
    - [ ] Add any additional comments you like about your process or any difficulties you may have had with the assignment
- [ ] Merge your branch into master, and delete your branch (don’t worry, the PR link will still work)

## Array Shift
Write a function called `insertShiftArray` which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

#### Example
|  Input | Output  | 
|---|---|
| ```[2,4,6,8], 5```  |  ```[2,4,5,6,8]``` | 
| ```[4,8,15,23,42], 16```  |  ```[4,8,15,16,23,42]``` |
